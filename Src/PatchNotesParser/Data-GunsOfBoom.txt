Version 4.4.4 (Jul 20, 2018)

Hey, Gunslinger! Version 4.4 is here, and it’s packed with new features, improvements, and possibilities. Here’s what we’ve got for you.
SCRAPS
This is a new type of resource you can get in exchange for duplicate items instead of automatically gaining gunbucks. Use scraps to buy all sorts of cosmetics right from the arsenal!

COLLECTIONS
For over a year, our victory cases dropped only a certain list of items. In a few days this will change, and new costumes and masks will start dropping. Finish assembling the cosmetics you’re currently working on, because on July 9 some of them will disappear from victory cases. Don’t worry though, you’ll be able to complete them at a later date.

OFFERS
We’ve added 2 new tabs to the game store: on the Cases tab you can get loads of cases, and the Outlet features extremely rare items available for a limited time. Choices, choices!

NEW THREADS
In several days we’ll update the contents of victory cases. Get ready for 9 new costumes and 7 cool masks. They will surely blow your mind!

VISUALS
We’ve improved the animations in the game, reworked some of the interface windows, and updated the models of Mamba, Juggernaut, Vampire and Thanatos. On top of that, we’ve revamped the skins for most of our guns! The game looks as good as ever!

PLANNING AHEAD
If you think we forgot about brawls and special events, you couldn’t be more wrong. We’ve got a whole set of cool activities planned for you. And if you think Top Gun and Rocket Party were cool, you’re in for some pleasant surprises. Stay tuned for more!
